This file describes location event triggers: they will execute some code
when the player is at a certain location.
Each trigger has the following field:
	- Name :  is a unique name for the trigger. For non silent triggers such 
	as teleporters, this is this name that will be displayed on screen.
	- Silent : (1 by default) is a flag that tells the game not to display the
	trigger on screen when the player puts the mouse cursor over it
	- Trigger at label : indicates what map label the event trigger is located at
	- <Luacode> : contains the lua code to execute

There are different kind of triggers:

Map labels: gets triggered when tux walks over it, needs
	Trigger at label="foo"

	Optional:
	Teleported=1 makes the label work only if the player is teleported on it.
	Teleported=0 will only only trigger the label if player walks over it
	Silent=1 will hide the label that will show when you hover the map label ingame.


Enemy death events: is triggered when a marked character dies, needs
	Trigger on enemy death
	Enemy level=24
	Enemy dialog name="DeadGuy"

Level triggers: are executed when tux enters/exits, changes to  a level, needs
	Trigger changing level
	Exiting level=0

	Note: you can combine Exiting and Entering level to only have a the event trigger
	when tux moves from defined level A to defined level B, e.g.:
	Exiting level=24
	Entering level=70

Obstacle triggers: is executed when tux performs an actions with an obstacle
(opens a chest, beats a barrel, etc), needs:
	Trigger on obstacle
	Obstacle label="tamara-book-1"
