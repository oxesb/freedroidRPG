PURPOSE = "$$NAME$$ teaches Tux melee combat, but only if Tux have prior knowledge on it because she can't stand weak linarians. In future there will be a quest to reunite her with Iris.",
BACKSTORY = "$$NAME$$ is part from the Rebel Faction. She worked with $$NPCID1$$ hunting bots and when they were to sleep at barracks, which was rare, they were roommates. On combat, $$NPCID1$$ was more careful to preserve droid drops and she would use brute force to smash and finish the bot \"for once and for all\". They are good friends, despite the contrasts on their personality and fighting style. They usually took solo missions but back home they told stories of their missions to each other. $$NAME$$ usually challenged $$NPCID1$$ to see who had killed more droids and most times than not, won. $$NPCID1$$ believes she is dead because $$NAME$$ went on a special, secret mission, given by $$NPCID2$$ personally, and never came back. She has fought with many robots before, and will not be scared by a mere linarian."
