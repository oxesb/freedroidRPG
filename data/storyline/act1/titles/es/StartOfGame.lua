Qué gran día.
Si, nuevamente estoy siendo sarcástico.
El planeta entero esta en llamas. 
Thousands of people are very dead.
Qwerty and Arensito are not responding.

Ah, yes, I almost forgot.
The bloody bots are about to find me, too.
I'm not very happy with that, Not happy at all.
I guess I have to pretend I'm just a nice rock, yet again.
Don't you think it would be a great time to wake up?
Get up. Get here. Save my ass.
Please.
