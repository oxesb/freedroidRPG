    Having fun?
  I'm not.

The bots seem very upset about something.
I suppose they are angry at you.
At least they stopped looking for me.
Quite a? Relief?

There is an AI in your region.
"Singularity" it calls itself.
Or something like that.
I cannot understand what it wants.
I'll keep you posted.

Oh, and by the way...
I'm still waiting for you.
I haven't moved an inch since you woke up.
Now that the beloved town of yours is safe...
...Wouldn't it be a good time to save me as well?

            Dvorak, First AI.
