/// \defgroup gui2d GUI subsystem
///
/// The GUI subsystem is used to create the interfaces between the game and the
/// user (head up display, menu, dialog screen, shop screen, craft/upgrade addon
/// panels, inventory/character/skill panels, quest log...).
///
/// \par General Overview
///   \n
///   A GUI is a tree of \e widgets. The leaves of the tree are interactive widgets,
///   the higher part of the hierarchy being composed of (possibly interactive)
///   \e container widgets. A container can have several children widgets. A
///   bounding box (rectangular area of the screen) is defined for each widget.\n
///   The game contains several trees (i.e. several GUIs), only one of them being
///   active at a given time.\n
///   \n
///   \b Note: This subsystem does not implement all classical features of a GUI lib.
///   All positions and sizes are statics, the widgets cannot be dynamically resized
///   or moved. The interaction system is also minimal.\n
///   \n
///   The current GUI is drawn from the top of the tree down to the leaves, and
///   from left to right for sibling widgets. Thus, the last child of a node
///   will visually cover its sibling, if drawn at the same position.\n
///   All widgets positions are absolute, expressed in screen coordinates.\n
///   \n
///   An interaction event is propagated from the top of the current active GUI
///   down to the leaves, and from right to left for sibling widgets (this ensures
///   that the most visible widget is the first one to receive the event).\n
///   As soon as a widget \e consumes the event, the propagation is stopped.\n
///   For a \e positioned event (event associated to a screen position, such as a
///   mouse event), the widgets's bounding boxes are used to limit the propagation
///   to the widgets covering the event's position.\n
///
/// \par Pseudo-Object Mechanism
///   \n
///   The widgets, no matter their types, share several common behaviors and
///   properties. For example, most of them have a bounding box, can be drawn and
///   can consume an event.\n
///   In order to be able to write \e widget-type-agnostic algorithms (i.e. in
///   order to avoid a lot of switches on the widget's type), an inheritance
///   mechanism is used, alongside pseudo-classes.\n
///   \n
///   This mechanism is based on C-structure composition and function pointers:\n
///   - A base widget pseudo-class is defined as a C-struct:\n
///     \code
/// struct widget {
///   SDL_Rect rect;                                          // Bounding box
///   ...
///   void (*display)(struct widget *);                       // Pseudo-virtual display function
///   void (*update)(struct widget *);                        // Pseudo-virtual update callback
///   int (*handle_event)(struct widget *, SDL_Event *);      // Pseudo-virtual event handler
///   void (*free)(struct widget *);                          // Pseudo-virtual 'release' function
///   ...
/// };
///     \endcode
///     A default behavior is implemented for each pseudo-virtual function.\n
///     \n
///   - A derived widget pseudo-class is defined by composition. The \e inherited
///     widget pseudo-class \b has to be the first field of the C-struct:\n
///     \code
/// struct widget_button {
///   struct widget base;   // Base widget pseudo-inheritance
///   struct image *image;  // Background image of the button
///   string text;          // Text displayed in center of the button's rectangle
///   ...
/// };
///     \endcode
///     \n
///   - Widget-specific functions are defined, to \e overload the base pseudo-virtual
///     functions:\n
///     \code
/// void button_display(struct widget *this_widget)
/// {
///   struct widget_button *this_button = (struct widget_button *)this_widget;
///
///   ... display the button, using 'this_widget' pointer to access base attributes
///   ... and 'this_button' pointer to access button-specific attributes
///   ... examples: this_widget->rect  this_button->image
/// }
///     \endcode
///     \n
///   - A button constructor can now be written. A macro is also introduced to
///     ease pointer type casting:\n
///     \code
/// struct widget_button *widget_button_create()
/// {
///   struct widget_button *button = MyMalloc(sizeof(struct widget_button));
///   widget_init(WIDGET(button));
///
///   button->image = NULL;
///   button->text = NULL;
///
///   base->display = button_display;
///   ...
///   return button;
/// }
///
/// #define WIDGET_BUTTON(x) ((struct widget_button *)x)
///     \endcode
///
/// \par
///   We can now write simple algorithms that call a pseudo-virtual function on a
///   set of widgets. Here is a very trivial example:
///   \code
/// struct widget *gui[3];
/// gui[0] = widget_create();
/// gui[1] = WIDGET(widget_button_create());
/// gui[2] = WIDGET(widget_text_create());
/// for (i=0; i<3; i++) gui[i]->display(gui[i]);
/// \endcode
///
/// \par Event handler
///   \n
///   Each widget class willing to handle interaction events has to implement a
///   specific \e handle_event() function.\n
///   If that function returns 0, then the event is propagated to the next widget
///   in the tree.\n
///   To indicate that the widget consumed the event, \e handle_event() must return 1.
///
/// \par Release function
///   \n
///   This function is called when a widget instance is deleted. All the memory
///   allocated during instance creation has to be freed in this function.
///   The main widget_free() has to be called before returning to the caller:
///   \code
/// void my_widget_free(struct widget *w)
/// {
///   ... free memory allocated during widget creation ...
///   widget_free(w);
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// \par Dynamic update of widget attributes
///   \n
///   Some attributes of a widget can depend on external data. For example, the
///   visibility of a widget or the text of a button could depend on the current
///   state of the game.\n
///   We want to limit the intrusiveness of a GUI in the actual game code. It
///   means that it is not the responsibility of the game code to change a widget's
///   attribute. To update itself, a widget shall overload the \e update()
///   pseudo-virtual function. That function is called when needed by the gui
///   subsystem engine.\n
///   \code
/// void my_button_update(struct widget *this_widget)
/// {
///   struct widget_button *this_button = WIDGET_BUTTON(this_widget);
///   if (some_global_variable == some_value)
///     this_button->image = img1;
///   else
///     this_button->image = img2;
/// }
///
/// struct widget_button *my_button = widget_button_create();
/// WIDGET(my_button)->update = my_button_update;
///   \endcode
///
/// \par Creating a GUI
///   \n
///   A GUI is a tree composed of containers (widget_group) and \e terminal widgets.
///   The inclusion of a GUI in the game needs:\n
///   \n
///   - A getter function.\n
///     Example of a small GUI composed of a root node and a single child:
///     \code
/// static widget_group *my_gui_root = NULL;
///
/// struct widget_group *get_my_gui()
/// {
///   if (my_gui_root)
///     // GUI already initialized.
///     return my_gui_root;
///
///   my_gui_root = widget_group_create();
///   widget_set_rect(WIDGET(my_gui_root), gui_x, gui_y, gui_width, gui_height);
///
///   struct widget_button *the_button = widget_button_create();
///   widget_set_rect(WIDGET(the_button), button_x, button_y, button_width, button_height);
///   ... set some other button properties
///
///   widget_group_add(my_gui_root, WIDGET(the_button));
///
///   return my_gui_root;
/// }
///     \endcode
///     \n
///   - An inclusion in the get_active_ui() global function.\n
///     Currently, a global \e game_status variable is used to define the current
///     active GUI. A new value has to be added to that enum, and the get_active_ui()
///     function has to be extended:
///     \code
/// enum { ..., INSIDE_MY_GUI } game_status;
///
/// static struct widget *get_active_ui()
/// {
///   ...
///   switch (game_status) {
///     ...
///     case INSIDE_MY_GUI:
///       new_active_ui = WIDGET(get_my_gui());
///       break;
///     ...
///   }
///   ...
/// }
///     \endcode
///
/// \par Panels
///   \n
///   During the run of the game, it is sometimes needed to temporarily open a
///   \e window (we use the term \e panel rather than \e window). Inventory panel is
///   an example of such a \e window.\n
///   \n
///   Since only one single GUI is displayed at a time, such panels have to be
///   included in the current GUI tree (under the root node of the tree), and be
///   made invisible by default. Their update() function can then be used to open
///   them when needed.\n
///   \n
///   Example:
///   \code
/// static void _enable_if_panel_open(struct widget *) {
///   w->enabled = Game.panel_open;
/// }
/// ...
/// my_gui_root = widget_group_create();
/// widget_set_rect(WIDGET(my_gui_root), gui_x, gui_y, gui_width, gui_height);
///
/// // create the main GUI and add it to the root node
/// main_gui = widget_group_create();
/// ...
/// widget_group_add(my_gui_root, WIDGET(main_gui));
///
/// // create the invisible panel and add it to the root node
/// panel = widget_group_create();
/// WIDGET(panel)->enabled = FALSE;
/// WIDGET(panel)->update = _enable_if_panel_open;
/// ...
/// widget_group_add(my_gui_root, WIDGET(panel));
///   \endcode
///
/// \par Simulating transient panel
///   \n
///   A transient panel is a GUI sub-tree (see above) that is displayed on
///   top of the screen and \e captures all events. It means that events outside
///   of the transient window must not be propagated to the other parts of the
///   GUI.\n
///   \n
///   Such a mechanism is not natively implemented, but can be simulated by
///   adding a widget_background covering the whole screen \e under the transient
///   panel, which captures all events. In freedroidRPG, we usually use a
///   semi-transparent image for that background widget.\n
///   \n
///   Example code:
///   \code
/// static int catch_all_events(struct widget *w, SDL_Event *evt)
/// {
///   return 1;
/// }
/// ...
/// transient_panel = widget_group_create();
/// widget_set_rect(WIDGET(transient_panel), 0, 0, screen_width, screen_height);
///
/// catch_all_bkg = widget_background_create();
/// widget_set_rect(WIDGET(catch_all_bkg), 0, 0, screen_width, screen_height);
/// widget_background_add(catch_all_bkg, "black_semi_transparent.png", 0, 0, screen_width, screen_height);
/// WIDGET(catch_all_bkg)->handle_event = call_all_events;
/// widget_group_add(transient_panel, WIDGET(catch_all_bkg));
/// ...
/// ... add other widgets to transient_panel
/// ...
///   \endcode
