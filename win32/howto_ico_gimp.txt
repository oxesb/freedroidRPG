Generating an ICO file using gimp
=================================

Ref: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4354617/how-to-make-get-a-multi-size-ico-file/10819673#10819673

Windows ICO files can be generated using GIMP following the steps
given. Basic outline is to create an image file in gimp using
successive layers. When exported to file, each layer of the image
represents ICO size in windows.

Prerequisites:
- ensure you are starting from an image that can be scaled from
256px^2 to 16px^2. A square SVG format image would be best.

- A square source image makes this process painless. If not, you
will be forced to spend extra time cropping each successive added
layer.

Steps to follow...
- start gimp
- create new file in gimp setting the canvas size to 256px X 256px

- select file->open as layer...
- navigate to image file (if SVG, enter 256px for image size)
--> This becomes the "Very Large icon in Windows"
- rename the layer - 256px
- select Layer->Layer Boundary Size...
--> Set Layer Boundary Size dialog opens
- In dialog, enter the pixel value you want (256px). Select "Center"
button. Adjust "Offset" to suit (but square images makes this
unnecessary). Select "Resize"
--> dialog closes and adjust layer presented.

- repeat the last five steps until you have the following layers:
256px
128px
64px ( qty 2)
48px ( qty 2)
32px ( qty 3)
16px ( qty 3)

- select file->Export...
- Navigate to where file is to be placed
- ensure filename has ".ico" extension <-- !IMPORTANT
- click "Okay"
-> gimp will open an "Export .ico" dialog. You can then
adjust the bpp and image compression for each layer in the file.

NOTE: For icon file attached to RR..
compression and 32bpp selected for 256px/128px
24bpp selected for first layer of other sizes (64,48,32 and 16px)
(it just looks better than 32bpp)
8bpp selected for second layer of other sizes (32 and 16px)
4bpp selected for third layer of other sizes (32 and 16px)

AND YOU HAVE SHINEY NEW .ICO FILE!!!!
