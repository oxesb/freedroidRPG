.Sh DESCRIPTION
FreedroidRPG tells the story of a world destroyed by a conflict
between robots and their human masters.  Play as Tux in a quest to
save the world from the murderous rebel bots who know no mercy.  You
get to choose which path you wish to follow, and freedom of choice is
everywhere in the game.
.Pp
FreedroidRPG features a real time combat system with melee and ranged
weapons, fairly similar to the proprietary game Diablo.  There is an
innovative system of programs that can be run in order to take control
of enemy robots, alter their behavior, or improve one's
characteristics.  You can use over 150 different kinds of items and
fight countless enemies on your way to your destiny.  An advanced
dialog system provides story background and immersive role playing
situations.
